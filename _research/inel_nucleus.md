## Intro
Inelastic nuclear scattering is the scattering in which the nucleus gets excited by one of the following
- a high energy particle like proton, neutron, electron, or even dark matter (2 to 2 scattering)
- a particle being absorbed by nucleus (2 to 1 scattering)

Shortly after the nucleus gets excited, it quickly (almost immediately) drop to ground state and meanwhile emits a photon. In experiment we catch this deexcitation photon as signal.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Such deexcitation photon has many advantages:
- Sharpness in energy spectrum: the photon has a defined energy, ie. it has a sharp energy spectrum, so it provides good statistics (statisical power, sensitivity, background reduction, etc)
- Documentation: there are enormous database and literacy that documented and studied the photon
- Efficiency: the detection of single-energy photon is efficient.

However, the disadvantages are
- Nuclear physics is complicated and challenging to compute
- Smaller rate than elastic scattering
- Narrower search range than elastic scattering


## Nuclear database
The database collects the state energy, spin, parity, lifetime, rate and so on for almost every nucleus.
