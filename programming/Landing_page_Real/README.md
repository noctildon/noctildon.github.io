This is a sample landing page for pitching a project idea called **FriendlyAlarm** to the targeted audience. It is built by:

- HTTP/CSS taught in the classes;
- [Bootstrap 4 (alpha 6)](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) for the responsive grid layout and components;
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for the icons;
- [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) for mocking up the UI of FriendlyAlarm;
- [Google Form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) for collecting user feedback.
- [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for page visit tracking.

Since the page is static (i.e., without any server-side code), you can host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for **free** and leverage the GitHub CDN to deliver the page to anywhere around the world **fast**.

Go build your own landing page and get **real** feedback early on. Good luck!
