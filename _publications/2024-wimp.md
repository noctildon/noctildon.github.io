abstract: 'We propose a new approach to search for light dark matter (DM) in the range of keV-GeV via inelastic nucleus scattering at large-volume neutrino detectors such as Borexino, DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-K. The approach uses inelastic nuclear scattering of cosmic-ray boosted DM, enabling a low-background search for DM in these experiments. The large neutrino detectors with higher threshold can be used since the nuclear deexcitation lines are $\mathcal{O}$(10) MeV. Using a hadrophilic dark-gauge-boson-portal model as a benchmark, we show that the nuclear inelastic channels generally provide better sensitivity than the elastic scattering for a large region of light DM parameter space.'
