abstract: 'Searches for axionlike particles (ALPs) are motivated by the strong CP problem in particle physics
and by unexplained dark matter in astrophysics. In this paper, we discuss novel ALP searches using
monoenergetic nuclear deexcitation photons from a beam dump, using the isotope decay-at-rest (IsoDAR)
experiment as an example. We show that IsoDAR can set limits that close a gap in traditional QCD axion
searches using the ALP-photon coupling, as well as provide sensitivity to large regions of new parameter
space in models where ALPs couple to nucleons and electrons. We also show how isotope decay-at-rest
experiments may be designed to improve potential ALP production and optimize detection sensitivity.'
