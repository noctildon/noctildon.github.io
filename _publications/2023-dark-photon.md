abstract: 'Here we present a novel probe of light (â‰² O(100) MeV) dark matter (DM) using pion decayat-rest experiments. Dark sector particles produced during pion decay can be detected when they scatter in a distant detector. The decay of nuclei excited by the inelastic scattering of DM is an unexploited channel which has significantly lower background compared to similar searches using
the elastic scattering channel. Using this channel, we demonstrate an increased sensitivity to a dark photon portal DM model compared to the existing constraints. The sensitivity of the DM parameter space is not restricted by the detector threshold as in the elastic channel. With existing experiments world-leading constraints on this parameter space have been obtained, reaching the thermal relic benchmark for scalar DM. Future experiments will be able to reach the thermal relic benchmark for
fermionic DM.'
