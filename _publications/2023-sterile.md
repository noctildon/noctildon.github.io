abstract: 'Stopped-pion experiments that measure coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) are sensitive to sterile neutrinos via disappearance. Using timing and energy spectra to perform flavor decomposition, we show that the delayed electron neutrino component provides an independent test of short-baseline anomalies that hint at âˆ¼ eV-mass sterile neutrinos. Dedicated experiments will be sensitive to nearly the entire sterile neutrino parameter space consistent with short-baseline data.'
