## Intro
This post will guide you through the set up of github page and build your own website using one of the most popular template jekyll. All of these are free!


## Methodology
Basically we follow [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) with some add-ons and corrections due to its outdated info.
Also notice that github page may need some time to deploy, depending on where their servers are. But typically it should be less than 10 minutes.


## Steps
- Follow [this](https://pages.github.com/) or [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to create an empty github page repo
- Follow [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install jekyll
- Clone my github page [source code](https://github.com/noctildon/noctildon.github.io) (which is the source code running this website)
- Run ``bundle exec jekyll serve`` in that repo, and wait a few seconds for it to compile
- Go to url 127.0.0.1:4000
  If you see the errors like below in the terminal and not seeing the icons show up on the left column (like Email, GitHub, etc)

```
Don't worry, just click any tab on the top and it should be working as normal
- Make some changes to the source code. To begin with, try modify ``_posts/2023-07-27-web.md`` and see the changes
- Then push the code to your github repo by ``git push``
- And it's done. Now you have your own website
