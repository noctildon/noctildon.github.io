I am a PhD student at physics department, [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), College Station, Texas, US.
My research interest includes
  - neutrino physics
  - nuclear physics
  - dark matter

My current research focuses on probing BSM ([Beyond Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model)) particles such as [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) and [axion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion) by inelastic nucleus scattering.

Apart from physics, I'm also interested in data science and machine learning in the applications. See [My Posts]({{ base_path }}/posts) for the projects I've done.
