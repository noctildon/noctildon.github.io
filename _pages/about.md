I am a PhD student at physics department, <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>, College Station, Texas, US.
My research interest includes
  - neutrino physics
  - nuclear physics
  - dark matter

My current research focuses on probing BSM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model">Beyond Standard Model</a>) particles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion">axion</a> by inelastic nucleus scattering.


Apart from physics, I'm also interested in data science and machine learning in the applications. See <a href="{{ base_path }}/posts">Posts</a> for the projects I've done.
